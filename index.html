      She is one of the most amazing people I've ever met, perfect personality. 
      Also really beautiful and supportive. I just wish there wasn't this "barrier" between us 
      so that I could reveal my true self, my true way of affection. 
      Not only towards her, but towards another person too.
      I am just scared of how they would react, If I showed
      my true way of affection towards people.
